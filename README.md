## Purpose 
A simple Google Chrome extension for effortless copying and pasting of slugs when locally testing Next.js projects with heavy usage of SSR dynamic pages. 

The idea came when I started getting a sore wrist and wanted to minimize large click and drag movements to copy paste very long dynamic URL routes ðŸ˜„

## Features

- **Localhost Convenience:** Launch a new localhost instance with an embedded slug in a dedicated tab, improving your testing workflow.
- **Effortless Slug Management:** Seamlessly copy and paste slugs during local testing without the need for cumbersome clicking and dragging.
- **Customization for Efficiency:** Tailor your slug copying experience by adjusting the depth of slug breadcrumb information.
